    <h1>Whoa Boat</h1>
    <p> Our boat is a <a href="https://ghboats.com/our-boats/17-salish-voyager/">
        Salish Sea Voyager boat (from Gig Harbor Boat Works).</a> We've been rowing it
        in the Cascade Lakes and we're excited to learn more about the salt rowing it out 
        of Mystery Bay.

        We have a forward rowing system we can install which allows me to row normally while
        facing forward. My neck doesn't turn like it used to so this is a great way to row and
        navigate without the strain. It looks weird, but it works well.
