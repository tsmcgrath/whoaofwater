    <h1>Papyrus</h1>
    <p>This is the full story behind "The Whoa of Water". 
        First, we were trying to come up with a good name 
        for our Salish Sea Voyager boat (from Gig Harbor Boat Works).
        It's both a tandem rowboat and a sailboat. Somehow "Whoa Boat"
        popped into my head. I love a pun. Even the bad ones.
        Then at some point shortly after that, I saw that the subtitle
        of film Avatar 2 was "The Way of Water", and I thought, "The Whoa of Water"!
        I'm a rafter, a former white-water canoer, and a wanna-be rower and sailor.
        Once we learn the ways of salt, sand, currents, and tides.
        Water has been a big part of our lives and so this suits us well. It's both
        funny and true. It may only be funny to me, but that's enough.
