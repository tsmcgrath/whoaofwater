    <h1>The Whoa of Water</h1>
    <p> This is the full story behind "The Whoa of Water".</p>
    <p> First, we were trying to come up with a good name 
        for our <a href="https://ghboats.com/our-boats/17-salish-voyager/">
        Salish Sea Voyager boat (from Gig Harbor Boat Works).</a>
        It's both a tandem rowboat and a sailboat. Somehow "Whoa Boat"
        popped into my head. I love a pun. Even the bad ones.
        Then at some point shortly after that, I saw that the subtitle
        of film Avatar 2 was "The Way of Water", and I thought, "The Whoa of Water"!
        I'm a rafter, a former white-water canoer, and a wanna-be rower and sailor.
        First we have to learn the ways of salt, sand, currents, and tides.
        Water has been a big part of our lives and so this suits us well. It's both
        funny and true. It may only be funny to me, but that's enough.
        </p>
    <h1>Papyrus Bold</h1>
    <p> So now, the name of the boat and the Avatar films are linked in my head. I saw an older
        Saturday Night Live clip called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ">
        Papyrus</a> with Ryan Gosling about a guy obsessing over the font that was used for 
        the title of the first Avatar movie. It's hilarious if you haven't seen it. 
        Then, a second and more current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8PdffUfoF0">
        Papyrus 2</a> comes out from SNL spoofing the second Avatar movie. With Gosling 
        reprising his role and at the end he's in for a surprise (I won't spoil it - just watch it). 
        So, now the boat name is "Whoa Boat" and it has to be in the font from the SNL skits (Papyrus Bold).
        The talented <a href="https://margauxmarinegraphics.com">
        Margeaux Serock of Margaux Marine Graphics</a> puts that together for us.
    </p>
    <p>May the Whoa of Water flow on</p>
